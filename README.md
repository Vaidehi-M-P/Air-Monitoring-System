# Air-Monitoring-System
This project uses an **MQ2** gas sensor to detect the concentration of **LPG** and **smoke** in the air, as well as monitoring **CO** (Carbon Monoxide) and **ARQ** values. The system displays the results on an LCD screen and triggers alarms using LEDs and a buzzer when dangerous gas levels are detected.
